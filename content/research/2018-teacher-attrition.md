title: "Teacher attrition in relation to comparable professions: Evidence from a repeated cross-sectional design"
date: 2018-04-01
abstract: "An important issue in education policy is whether the national rate of teacher attrition in the U.S. is higher than expected. A study by Harris and Adams [Harris, D. N. and Adams, S. J. (2007). Understanding the level and causes of teacher attrition: A comparison with other professions. Economics of Education Review] compares teachers to arguably similar vocational professions, including nursing, social work, and accounting. In this paper I build upon Harris and Adams (2007) by conducting a repeated cross-sectional analysis of teacher attrition in relation to other professions. I find that the rate of teacher attrition has remained strikingly stable over time at around 8 percent and exhibits less variation than comparable professions. Teachers and nurses share similar rates of attrition. A decline in the labor force leaver rate among older teachers approaching retirement explains a small decrease in the overall attrition rate between 2001 and 2017."
